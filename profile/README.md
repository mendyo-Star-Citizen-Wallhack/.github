## 🧬 What Is a Wallhack in Star Citizen?

A **wallhack** is a visual mod that overlays important game entities on your screen — even through solid objects. Think of it like X-ray goggles that show:

* Enemies hiding behind walls
* Gear stashes behind doors
* Turrets waiting around corners
* Ships parked out of sight
* AI patrols in sealed rooms

Built into an **ESP framework**, the wallhack works in real-time, giving you a **tactical awareness advantage** in every scenario.
